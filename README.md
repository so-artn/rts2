# SO-ARTN RTS2 Branch
Official so-artn branch of rts2. Looking at the rts2 installed and running on bigartn, it was the branch "ngdome". I have created a new branch, this one, from ngdome. This will be our master branch from now on. 

RTS2 - Remote Telescope System, 2nd Version
===========================================

RTS2 is software for a fully autonomous astronomical observatory. It takes care
of details necessary for the observatory operation. It keeps care of closing it
when bad weather arrives, opening when weather permits operation. One of its
driving requirements was to provide a modular and flexible environment, able to
control a lot of (quickly changing) devices.

RTS2 is split into two main components - the RTS2 library, released under LGPL,
and RTS2 drivers, released under GPL. Pleasse see COPYING.LESSER and COPYING and 
header of source files for details.

RTS2 is not an interactive planetarium. RTS2 provides various interfaces which
third parties can use to access system functionalities. Probably the best is
JSON API. [Stellarium](http://stellarium.org) has plugin to interact with RTS2
telescopes.

to parties sharing development and implementation costs.
